# capstone-front-end
get a random cooking recipe!

Have you ever been at home, and had no idea what you wanted to eat for the week, or that night? With this website/app, you will be able to click a button, and boom, you have a recipe for that night. The user will be able to choose between breakfast, lunch and dinner. The randomize button will provide two recipes for the user to choose, then they can click one and it will show further details. It is good to have a couple options! For phase one, this will be the minimal funcitionality. Users will also be allowed to comment on each post to share how the dish tasted, and if they used any different ingredients. 

The front end of this project will be created in react, while the backend will be done in Flask and Python. 

I will be using an API called spoonacular that can generate random recipes.

After the minimum featues are created, I would like to add options for gluten free, dairy free, vegan and vegetarian.
